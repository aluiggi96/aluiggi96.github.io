      <h2>What is the flower of the sun?</h2>
      <p>
        Sunflower, (genus Helianthus), genus of nearly 70 species of herbaceous
        plants of the aster family (Asteraceae). Sunflowers are native primarily
        to North and South America, and some species are cultivated as
        ornamentals for their spectacular size and flower heads and for their
        edible seeds. The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus) is
        cultivated for its edible underground tubers.

      <p>
        The distribution of Helianthus annuus is throughout almost all of North
        America from central Canada to northern Mexico. Also widespread
        distribution is present across many European countries. Although not
        shown on this map Russia is a major cultivating ground for sunflowers,
        it has become the foremost producer of sunflowers due to its popularity
        as a form of oil.

      <h3>Habitat</h3>
      <p>
        Common Sunflower is an open land species, generally on moist soils. It
        is a species of prairies and other grasslands, old fields, roadsides,
        railroad rights-of-way, savannas, and forest edge. It is found across
        the conterminous U.S., but probably is native to the central and
        southern portion of the range and Mexico.

      <h2>Benefit from the sunflowers</h2>
      <p>
        Studies found that consumption of seeds — including sunflower seeds —
        was linked to lower rates of cardiovascular disease, high cholesterol,
        and high blood pressure. Sunflower seeds are a source of many vitamins
        and minerals that can support your immune system and increase your
        ability to fight off viruses.
